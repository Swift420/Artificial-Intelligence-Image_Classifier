# Image Classification with Artificial inteliigence
An image classiﬁer using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The images, accessible at https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia, represent chest X-ray images of patients. Two possible types of labels are considered: normal and pneu- monia. Put another way, each sample represents either a normal patient or a patient suﬀering from pneumonia. Model is built following AlexNet architecture.
